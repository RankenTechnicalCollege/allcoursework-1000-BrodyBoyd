  <h2>Hobby: Playing Video Games</h2>
  <p>I enjoy playing all kinds of video games.  I started gaming when I was young and have just kept with it.
    I have recorded thousands of hours over many games and many years.  I've come to enjoy Elden Ring and other "Souls like" games recently.
    I also enjoy shooters and sports games very much.  I play games on both my computer and my PS5.
