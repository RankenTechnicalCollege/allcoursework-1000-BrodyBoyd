  <h1>Lala Land</h1>
  <p><br> Lala Land is a movie that follows two main characters, Mia and Sebastian.  They both have big dreams, to own a jazz club and to become an actress.
  Their paths cross and so begins this romantic love story between the two.  This movie sadly is not just happy, its also rather sad, but Im not going to spoil why.</p>
